RIP CmarNYC, October 2023

This is the source to CmarNYC's TS4MorphMaker, extracted from the ModTheSims version MTS_CmarNYC_1896914_TS4MorphMakerSource_4-19-23, and lightly massaged to work with Visual Studio 2022

Prerequisites: https://github.com/s4ptacle/Sims4Tools

To build: build the Sims4Tools assemblies, and then in the TS4MM project, Debug-> Ts4MorphMaker Debug properties, select Reference Paths, add the path to your Sims4Tools bin dirs (probably ..\Sims4Tools\bin\Release\ or \Debug\), and then Build solution.

I take no credit for or rights to the code, only for adding a few missing references and getting it to compile in VS2022.
